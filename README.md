# Gas-Detection-System-with-Real-Time-Alert


This project is basically an IoT and Embedded System one done with Flask, Twillio, ThinkSpeak and Front End Development

• Impletted a system to detect smoke and alert the community security and members with message notification for a
certain threshold. Above a limit automatic call to fire department -100. Used ThinSpeak API for analysis of smoke.


• IoT system is done on Arduino IDE and back-end results are connected with python using Flask for data
transmission. Data transmission from 2 or more sensors are handled.


The project is made in Python and Embedded C.

Flask is used for backend integration between Arduino IDE and my frontend dashboard which made in HTML.

app.py contains the backend code and index.html is the dashboard code.

code.ino is the arduino ide code for detection of gas and smoke from the sensors.
