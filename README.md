# Gas-Detection-System-with-Real-Time-Alert


This project is basically an IoT and Embedded System one done with Flask, Twillio, ThinkSpeak and Front End Development

• Impletted a system to detect smoke and alert the community security and members with message notification for a
certain threshold. Above a limit automatic call to fire department -100. Used ThinSpeak API for analysis of smoke.
• IoT system is done on Arduino IDE and back-end results are connected with python using Flask for data
